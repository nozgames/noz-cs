# Multi-Channel SDF (MSDF) Sprites

NoZ uses multi-channel signed distance fields to render resolution-independent sprites with sharp corners. The implementation is a faithful port of [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) by Viktor Chlumsky, located in `noz/editor/src/msdf2/`.

## Why MSDF

Single-channel SDF produces rounded artifacts at sharp corners. At a vertex where two edges meet, the minimum distance forms a circular iso-contour around the vertex, rounding the corner. This is inherent to scalar distance fields and cannot be fixed by increasing resolution.

MSDF solves this by encoding distance information across three channels (R, G, B). At sharp corners, the channels disagree about which edge is closest, and the `median(r, g, b)` reconstruction in the shader preserves the sharp boundary.

## Architecture

### Pipeline

1. **Shape conversion** (`MsdfSprite.FromSpritePaths`): Sprite paths and anchors are converted to msdf2 `Shape`/`Contour`/`EdgeSegment` objects. Linear anchors become `LinearSegment`, curved anchors become `QuadraticSegment` with the control point computed from the curve value.

2. **Normalize** (`Shape.Normalize`): Single-edge contours are split into thirds so edge coloring has enough edges to assign distinct colors.

3. **Edge coloring** (`EdgeColoring.ColorSimple`): Edges are assigned R/G/B channel colors. At sharp corners (where `dot(dir_a, dir_b) <= 0` or `|cross(dir_a, dir_b)| > sin(3.0)`), adjacent edges get different colors. This is the key step that creates multi-channel differentiation.

4. **MSDF generation** (`MsdfGenerator.GenerateMSDF`): For each pixel, the generator finds the nearest edge per channel and computes a signed distance using perpendicular distance extension (pseudo-SDF) at edge endpoints. Output is a float RGB bitmap with values in [0, 1] where 0.5 = on edge.

5. **Compositing** (`MsdfSprite.RasterizeMSDF`): Additive and subtract paths are generated separately, then composited. Subtract shapes are inverted and intersected (min) with the additive result.

### Integration Point

`Shape.Rasterize.cs` delegates `RasterizeMSDF()` to `Msdf2.MsdfSprite.RasterizeMSDF()`. The call site in `SpriteDocument.cs` passes:
- `target`: atlas pixel data (RGBA8)
- `targetRect`: output region in the atlas
- `sourceOffset`: maps pixel coordinates back to shape-space
- `pathIndices`: which paths to rasterize
- `range`: distance range in pixels (default 1.5)

### Coordinate Mapping

The generator maps pixel coordinates to shape-space:
```
shapePos = (pixel + 0.5) / scale - translate
```
Where `scale = (dpi, dpi)` and `translate = sourceOffset / dpi`. The distance range is converted from pixels to shape units: `rangeInShapeUnits = range / dpi * 2.0`.

## Shader

The MSDF shader (`noz/engine/assets/shader/texture_msdf.wgsl`) reconstructs the shape boundary:

```wgsl
fn median(r: f32, g: f32, b: f32) -> f32 {
    return max(min(r, g), min(max(r, g), b));
}

@fragment
fn fs_main(input: VertexOutput) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    let msd = textureSample(texture0, sampler0, input.uv).rgb;
    let dist = median(msd.r, msd.g, msd.b);

    let dx = dpdx(dist);
    let dy = dpdy(dist);
    let edgeWidth = 0.7 * length(vec2<f32>(dx, dy));

    let alpha = smoothstep(0.5 - edgeWidth, 0.5 + edgeWidth, dist);
    return vec4<f32>(input.color.rgb, alpha * input.color.a);
}
```

The adaptive `edgeWidth` from screen-space derivatives ensures clean anti-aliasing at any zoom level.

## SdfMode

The sprite binary format uses `SdfMode` to distinguish rendering modes:
- `None` (0) — normal RGBA color
- `Sdf` (1) — single-channel SDF (R only)
- `Msdf` (2) — multi-channel SDF (RGB)

MSDF uses the same atlas space as regular sprites (RGBA8). Three channels encode distance; the alpha channel is unused (set to 0).

## Error Correction

The msdf2 port includes a legacy error correction pass (`MsdfGenerator.ErrorCorrection`) that detects "clashing" texels where bilinear interpolation between adjacent pixels would produce incorrect median values. **This is currently disabled** because the legacy `detectClash` algorithm is too aggressive for sprite use — it replaces multi-channel data with the median, destroying the corner sharpness that makes MSDF work.

If artifacts appear at specific edge configurations, the modern error correction from msdfgen (which protects corners and edges via a stencil buffer) would need to be ported.

## Edge Coloring Details

`EdgeColoring.ColorSimple` uses msdfgen's algorithm with seed-based pseudo-random color selection:

- **No corners**: All edges get the same two-channel color (e.g., CYAN)
- **One corner** ("teardrop"): Three color regions assigned via `symmetricalTrichotomy`, with edge splitting if fewer than 3 edges
- **Multiple corners**: Colors switch at each corner using `switchColor` with a seed, and the last spline's color is constrained to differ from the initial color to avoid wrap-around conflicts

The angle threshold of 3.0 radians (~172 degrees) means any junction sharper than ~172 degrees triggers a color change.

## Subtract Path Handling

Subtract paths (holes) are handled by generating a separate MSDF and compositing:
1. Additive paths produce an MSDF where inside > 0.5
2. Subtract paths produce a separate MSDF
3. The subtract MSDF is inverted (1 - value) so its inside becomes outside
4. The two are intersected per-channel via `min(add, inverted_sub)`
